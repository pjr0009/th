    We request information from you on our order form. To buy from us, you must provide contact information (like name and shipping address).

Tack Hunter does not store any of this payment information on its servers, and we require that you do not to take transactions offsite, doing so could expose you to additional risks, and we're unable to help if you did not complete the transaction through our service.
